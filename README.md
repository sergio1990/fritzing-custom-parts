# Fritzing compatible custom parts

[Fritzing app](https://fritzing.org/) comes with a various built-in parts. But in reality the number of different modules/boards/electronic components/etc is so vast, so it's really hard to cover all of them within a some specific team, therefore, there is a possibility for [adding custom parts](https://fritzing.org/learning/tutorials/creating-custom-parts). The official guide for the part file format can be found [here](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app/wiki/2.1-Part-file-format).

This repo contains a set of manually built parts for the Fritzing app. The [Inkscape app](https://inkscape.org/) is primarily used for drawing SVGs for different views of each particular part.

### Other useful resources

There are other resources where custom Fritzing parts can be found:

- [the official Fritzing forum](https://forum.fritzing.org/c/parts-submit/23) where people around the world submit their customly built parts
- [Adafruit Fritzing library](https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library)
